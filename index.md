## The Friv Classic Reborn History

Welcome to this small Friv Classic Reborn history. Hope you enjoy.

### The Amazing Idea

One day at my house, I was imagining things and then .. I came up with a great idea .... FRIV CLASSIC REBORN! It was born as a different logo from the one at the end with the symbol of "BETA" and then, I came up with the idea of a challenge ... Christmas challenge called "Winter Wonderland Challenge" With Chuzzle Christmas Edition as the game, But the idea was discarded.

This is how the challenge would look.

Days later created a simple keys menu, Looked like this

Was also discarded.

Later, replaced two games "Super Mario Bros, Sonic The Hedgehog" with Papa Louie 2 and 3 because of copyright issues and because i wanted to keep the project safe. And later did some patches for the menu and some days after a repository on GitHub named FrivReborn was born.

When Setting up the first game "I Wanna Win" I setted up the Pages settings and Friv Classic Reborn was globaly born.
