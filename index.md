## The Friv Classic Reborn History

Welcome to this big Friv Classic Reborn history. Hope you enjoy.

### The Amazing Idea

One day at my house, I was imagining things and then .. I came up with a great idea .... FRIV CLASSIC REBORN! It was born as a different logo from the one at the end with the symbol of "BETA" and then, I came up with the idea of a challenge ... Christmas challenge called "Winter Wonderland Challenge" With Chuzzle Christmas Edition as the game, But the idea was discarded.

This is how the challenge would look.
